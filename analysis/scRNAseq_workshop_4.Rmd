# Interactive visulization with iSEE package

We primary used `Seurat` package to work with the single-cell data. However, there are a lot of other cool [bioconductor packages](https://bioconductor.org/) to work with single-cell data as well. In this section, I will introduce you to `iSEE` package which provides cool interactive visulization for the single-cell data sets.

`iSEE` is a bioconductor package and it works with the `SingleCellExperiment` object not the `Seurat` object. Let's convert it first.

More converion examples can be found https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/conversion_vignette.html

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
library(iSEE)
#read in the 5k pmbc data we created before
pbmc<- readRDS("data/pbmc5k/pbmc_5k_v3.rds")
# Seurat object
pbmc

pbmc.sce <- as.SingleCellExperiment(pbmc)
# SingleCellExperiment object
pbmc.sce
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
## feed to iSEE
iSEE(pbmc.sce)
```

It opens the `Shiny` Application and now we are ready to do some interactive exploration of the data set!
